Restaurant Reviews App (Stage 1)
===============================

## Description

* This project was created as part of my Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree course. My job was to add responsiveness and accessibility  to a static webpage and turn it into a mobile-ready web application. I also added a service worker for user-friendly offline experience.

## How to Run the Application

* Download the project as a .zip file or clone using:

    ```
    $ https://github.com/ernest-alilovic/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git
    ```

* In this folder, set up a local testing server to view the site in your browser. Python is the easiest way to do this. Mac users have it already installed on their computer. If you don't have Python, however, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* In your computer's terminal, check the version of Python you have using `python -V`. This will confirm that Python is installed and ready to go. If you have Python 2.x, set up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server`. You should see something like `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...`

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`. When you are done viewing just press CTRL+C to stop the server. Enjoy!

## How to Run the Application

The starter code for this project was provided by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). The application uses [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
